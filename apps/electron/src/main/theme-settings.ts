/**
 * The theme the renderer last committed, mirrored into the main process.
 *
 * The renderer owns theme state in its own `localStorage`, which main cannot
 * read — and the window's `backgroundColor` and the Windows caption overlay
 * have to be decided before any renderer code runs. (The `.dark` class itself
 * is applied by the boot script in `index.html`, which CAN read that storage.)
 * Without this mirror the native frame can only follow the OS appearance, so a
 * user on an explicit dark theme under a light system gets a white window
 * frame and caption buttons around a dark page.
 *
 * A preview (hovering a theme in Settings) deliberately does not land here:
 * only a committed choice describes how the next launch should look.
 *
 * Opening the file cannot fail fatally — `createMainSettingsStore` degrades to
 * defaults for the launch — so the guards below only cover a file that breaks
 * AFTER construction, which `conf` notices because it re-reads on every `get`.
