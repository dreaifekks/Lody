# Preserve reading gaps inside assistant work

## Abstract

Long progress paragraphs and tool summaries crowded together because expanded
completed work forced every child into a zero-padding process row. Progress prose
and group headers now retain a 6px conversation prose gap, while individual
tool details keep their compact pitch. Reading leading increases
from 22px to 24px at 14px text. Expanded conversations use more vertical space in
exchange for clearer separation between explanations and tool activity.

## Decision and evidence

This partially replaces the density choices in the [previous rhythm decision](../simplification/2026-10-03-conversation-rhythm-stylex.md).
The [rhythm Spec](../../../../specs/conversation-rhythm.md) owns the current formulas.
The virtual-row renderer chooses spacing by content kind even inside worked groups;
`isWorkedDetail` continues to own tone and grouping, not prose spacing. The first
assistant row still has no extra top gap. Response and next-round reserves retain
their existing ownership and values.

A 12px gap on both sides of each summary separated related work too much; the
final 6px gap keeps summaries close to their surrounding prose.
Increasing only reading leading would leave zero separation around progress text.
The synthetic progress stories therefore alternate wrapped Chinese/mixed-script
paragraphs with tool summaries, in completed and streaming states. No captured
conversation is used. Browser assertions measure both directions of the 6px gap
and verify that expanding a tool summary adds no gap before its first detail.

## Verification and limits

Validation uses an isolated copy with dependencies and current tracked source.
All 20 interface typography browser tests pass, covering reading leading, all
five sizes, light/dark and narrow layouts, folding, action access and theme overrides.
The virtual-row identity and turn-block suites pass all 26 tests. Components type
checking and formatting of changed TypeScript files pass. Before/after screenshots
of the same expanded synthetic story were visually inspected. The
[Playwright comparison](../../assets/conversation-progress-spacing/before-vs-after.png)
uses identical 1120 × 1200 viewports, 14px text, dark theme and expanded work.
Root checks in the primary worktree remain blocked by missing dependencies;
document checks report the same 62 pre-existing errors, with no new errors or
SHA-protected topics.
The Spec remains draft; implementation does not imply human approval.
