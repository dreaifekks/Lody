/**

 *
 * Every write resolves as soon as `flockRowPut`/`flockRowDelete` lands — that is
 * the point at which the row exists and the UI can move on. The explicit upload
 * still runs, but nobody waits for it and no surface reports it:
 *
 * - it is a round trip, and blocking an editor on it made a finished, already
 *   durable save sit there looking unfinished for seconds;
 * - failing it is not a failed save, and the old "saved on this device but not
 *   yet synced" banner said something the user could neither act on nor dismiss;
 * - the catalog room stays joined while any consumer is mounted, so a document
 *   this one-shot upload could not push reconciles on the room's own sync.
 *
 * What must never happen is the opposite: reporting a write as failed, or
 * rolling one back, because the upload did not go through.
