# Shared contracts

`CLAUDE.md` symlinks here. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.

Discover archive/restore/delete from one ready Repo snapshot, never UI caches.
Archive uses `collectSessionArchiveTargets`; restore/delete keep direct containment.
Exact deletion bypasses discovery: [relations](../../specs/session-relations.md).

## Session history

- Session history storage tolerates unknown string item types from newer peers without
  rewriting them or blocking unrelated writes. Keep known-type guards and external-input
  parsing; `tests/session-doc-forward-compat.test.ts` covers this separately from unknown root keys.
- `createSessionMirror` is the renderer/CLI session entrypoint. Its `HistoryWriter`
  owns local history writes, including legacy callback updates; no raw history writes
  or second Mirror writer. Read-path feature flags must never change this owner.
- Validate new turns and changed known fields/items before applying a command, never
  unchanged history. Invalid commands preserve the old values and throw content-free
  diagnostics; they must not leave partial history writes. Keep stored unknown fields
  and unchanged opaque items; do not sanitize/rewrite a whole stored document.
- New inputs use the shared message parsers. Known protocol extension dictionaries
  retain JSON data, not arbitrary JS objects. Storage layout is an insertion policy in
  `schema.ts`: new metadata strings stay primitive and `LoroText` is declared only for
  streaming fields, at every nesting level. Stored values keep their representation and
  opening never rewrites them.

- Parser coverage must include nested discriminators (`system_notice.name`) and
  correlated metadata, not just item `type`. Fork regression tests must cross the
  actual SessionDocument/HistoryWriter boundary; a mock updateHistory cannot prove it.
- Copying stored history uses a writer-captured snapshot, never a caller-supplied "trusted"
  array. Preserve unchanged opaque content; parse authored changes and new notices. Prepend
  copies without replacing target initialization containers; reject colliding ids. Rollback
  captures only the changed range, retains untouched/later rows, and rejects row identity/order
  edits in that range, except pending-to-seen on newly inserted user rows.
  External ACP imports remain new input.
- Session data ports (`src/session-data`): UI/CLI business depends on `SessionData`
  (explicit set/clear and shared writer validation), never a second history writer.
  Invariants: [session-data scope](src/session-data/AGENTS.md).
- Tool fields other than type/toolCallId are independent
  edits: derive their parsers from the tool message schema and validate changed fields,
  not untouched stored payloads. Content-list edits retain unchanged blocks and parse
  authored blocks; tool identity changes still use the complete item parser.
- Normalize legacy built-in CLI selectors on new history input only. Independent stored
  input-config metadata edits validate changed fields, not untouched historical values.
- ACP tool blocks and locations are explicit JSON extension boundaries. Unknown block
  types must not bypass validation of malformed known variants. Preserve declared `_meta`
  and extension keys; closed execution configuration still selects declared fields.
- Steer provenance is a declared history input-config field, not an unknown extension.
  Both new writes and read normalization must retain it for edit-and-resend checks.
- Scalar/fileDiff writes read and diff only the requested field, never the turn's items.
  Writer input parsers derive from schema definitions with all refinements retained;
  never mutate the original RPC schemas. Parsing filters and validates in one pass.
  `readStored` returns detached JSON for hashing, not stored-copy provenance. Keep `capture`
  protection for callers that can author copies from an old snapshot.
- Target-local streaming uses `updateEntry`; it must not produce/plan the entire history.
  Resolve the live turn on each call, preserve immutable ids, and preflight before writing.
  Generic history updates remain for operations with cross-turn ownership or structural edits.
- Permission responses inspect request metadata and materialize only the matching turn;
  a supplied turn id restricts lookup to that turn. Preserve legacy JSON metadata on lookup.
- Mirror's text-event optimization ships upstream in pinned `loro-mirror`; no local patch
  exists and no storage schema or write validation depends on it.
- Subagent events must preserve run identity and root ownership.

## Machine protocol negotiation

- Ask Question consumers must preserve Core note/replacement semantics and validate
  associations per the [notes contract](../../specs/ask-question-answer-notes.md).

- Independent Plan configuration uses Core's boolean `plan_mode`, including static
  capabilities, semantic dispatch, and UI toggles. Preserve `collaboration_mode`
  default/plan only for agents that advertise the legacy option; planning must not
  change permission policy.

- Daemon workflows gate on `MachineMeta.protocolCapabilities`, never CLI version.
  Missing means unsupported; keep key/version pairs in `machine-protocol-capabilities.ts`.
- ACP capability `cacheVersion` controls refresh freshness, never readability. Consumers
  preserve understood fields from parsed older or newer entries during mixed-version
  operation, adapting only fields with known incompatible semantics; runtime-override source
  matching remains a separate applicability gate.
- Rate limits use `agentConfigId + limitId`; bound Providers ignore legacy
  machine/type rows, and deletion removes scoped rows.

## Session goal control

- A goal action's transport follows what it does, not what the agent is. Status-only
  actions (`pause`, `clear`) use the `_lody/session/goal` request and must reach a
  goal whose prompt is still open; actions that start work (`set`, `resume`) run
  inside a Lody-owned prompt carrying `_meta.lody.goalControl`, because every unit of
  agent work needs a conversation entry to be attributed to. Never start goal work
  from the request path.
- Offer only the actions the runtime advertised in its ACP capability, never a
  provider name check. A goal turn carries no run configuration, so resuming cannot
  change model or mode. Behavior: [goal control Spec](../../specs/session-goal-control.md).

## Workspace MCP / Roles

- Workspace MCP has exactly two durable layers: catalog entries in the workspace Flock
  document and selected ids in each user turn input config. Do not add machine bindings.
  Preserve `mcpServerIds: []` as an explicit empty selection; dispatch must carry the
  driving turn's selection into ACP startup rather than rereading session history.
- MCP/Role catalog writes resolve on local Flock durability, followed by explicit
  upload. Settings neither await nor report upload; upload failure must not fail or
  roll back a durable write. CLI reports its sync result. See
  [catalog explanation](../../.agents/docs/workspace-catalog-durability.md).
- Roles use one workspace Flock `agentRole` family; sharing changes `visibility`.
  No secrets, API keys, MCP selections or memory contents. Apply
  `isSensitiveAgentRoleConfigOptionKey` on read/write. Permission pins use
  `runConfig.modeId` or `_permission`: hide the separate composer permission
  button but retain warning-tone markings. No Role-level auto-approval policy.
  Settings/mentions use `canReadAgentRole`/`canManageAgentRole`; explicit MCP
  lookup needs no mention grant.
- Roles bind `machineId + agentConfigId`; no fallback. Unavailable machine/config/model/mode
  stays listed with reasons, unmentionable. Freeze Role prompt/target/revision/config
  at acceptance; retries/recovery ignore edits/deletion. Session Role metadata:
  provenance only. `resolveSessionExecutionInputBlocks` owns text; raw blocks supply attachments.
- Memory stores provider/id references, frozen per turn. Daemon commands and env
  mapping follow the [memory contract](../../specs/agent-role-memory.md).
- Keep `author`, human `userId`, and recipient execution config separate.
